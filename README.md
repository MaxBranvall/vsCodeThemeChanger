# VS Code Theme Changer

1. Visit [sunrise-sunset](https://sunrise-sunset.org/) and get your locations latitude and longitude.
2. Input your latitude and longitude values into json/config.json.
3. Specify your desired light and dark theme in the same file. (these are defaulted to the default light and dark themes)
4. Run the script.
5. You're done!

* You can keep this script running 24/7 and your VS Code color theme will automatically change on sunrise and sunset.


## Disclaimer

* At the moment the script is configured for CST (central standard time). I may add a configuration for different time zones in the future. If you'd like to use the script in a different time zone just let me know and I'll help you out.


# Enjoy!
