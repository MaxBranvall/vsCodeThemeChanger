# VS Code Theme Changer

1. Visit [sunrise-sunset](https://sunrise-sunset.org/) and take note of the latitude and longitude of your location.
2. Input your latitude and longitude values into config/config.json.
3. Specify your desired light and dark theme in the same file. (these are defaulted to the default light and dark themes)
4. Run the script.
5. You're done!

* You can keep this script running 24/7 and your VS Code color theme will automatically change on sunrise and sunset.

# Dependancies

* `Requests` is the only dependancy is required to run this script. If you do not already have this installed, simply run
